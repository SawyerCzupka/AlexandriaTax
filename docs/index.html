    <h1>Data 303 Project - Taxes in Alexandria Properties</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The city of Alexandria is one of Virginia's largest cities in terms of population. In recent years especially, its seen much growth industrially and economically. This growth can be seen reflected in the city's taxation.</p>
    <p>In this project, real world data on housing info in Alexandria was used to </p>

    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>The data was recieved by [Noah] </p>
    <p>For our main plot, the Folium library was used. We decided to go with a choropleth with a time slider to show the change of taxes over time. </p>
    <p>To get correct coordinate locations for our eventual folium map, the [API - Sawyer]</p>
    <p>One of our first major issues with this was that our original dataset did not contain addresses with zip codes, so the API pulled coordinates of other matching addresses from other zip codes. This inaccuracy ranged anywhere from cities next to Alexandria to Ontario, Canada. Because of this, much of the coordinate data was initially unusable.</p>
    <p>Another issue we ran into with a simple plot of all the points is that choropleths generally work better showing larger, more genralizable regions. To accomodate for this, we decided to plot the data grouping by zip code. As there was no readily avaiable geojson file for this purpose, a geojson file was created by the group with geojson.io, using the following Alexandria zip code map and the official Alexandria boundaries json file provided by the Alexandria Open Data project as reference to map the points accurately.</p>

    <p>Beyond the geojson boundaries, we also ran into another familiar issue with our plan - our original dataset included addresses without the zip codes. Once we recieved the zip codes, it seemed like all of our problems would be fixed. Because of our new method, exact coordinates for each address would also be unecessary, as we would just need to map each address's data to its respective zip code.</p>
    <p>Our zip code issues were solved using the USPS API to lookup zip codes to addresses. From this point, it was only a matter of plotting our data to the geojson boundaries in our TimeSliderChoropleth.</p>
