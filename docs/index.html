    <h1>Data 303 Project - Taxes in Alexandria Properties</h1>
    <h3>By: Sawyer Czupka, Bingrui Li, Noah Schuerhoff 
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The city of Alexandria is one of Virginia's largest cities in terms of
      population. In recent years especially, its seen much growth industrially
      and economically. This growth can be seen reflected in the city's
      taxation and rising housing costs. However, our visualization posits that
      this growth was unequally distributed so to speak. This is to say, 2 of the 7
      zipcodes within Alexandria's borders are experiencing financial growth that
      seemingly dwarfs the rest of Alexandria's municipalities. Previous iterations
      of this visualization further supported this perspective as our color scalar,
      depicting these averages, was completely thrown off by the highest value properties.
      That is to say, regardless of the growth in the averages for property tax and
      assesment value, those changes were imperceptible because our color scale was
      tied to the range of every entry, as opposed to the range of averages. This revealed
      that the distribution of high value properties is actually low, as their contribution
      to the average, despite their exceedingly high values, couldn't skew the aggregate 
      toward that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this project, real world data on housing info in Alexandria was used to
    observe tax values over time.</p>

    <br />

    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>
      We acquired this data from a web-scraping algorithm originally designed
      by Barrett Dalbec, one of Noah's colleagues. It worked by sending requests
      to alexandria.gov's realestate portal, loading each page and recording the
      necessary information in a dataframe, which we packaged into a csv. This
      scraper produced a dataframe listing the assessment values as well as the
      property taxes paid for every address on record. This scraper required
      around the clock supervision, and some minor adjustments, to procure all
      the information we needed. As a result of the sheer scale of the number of
      requests we were making, this program took over 20 hours to successfully
      run.
    </p>

    <p>This dataset comprised of nearly 40 thousand rows of information.</p>
    
    <br>

    <p>
      For our main plot, the Folium library was used. We decided to go with a
      choropleth with a time slider to show the change of taxes over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, because our webscraper didn't acquire all the necessary
      information to geocode, we needed to access the Nominatim API to retrieve the
      necessary information for geocoding. To get correct coordinate locations for our eventual folium map, the Nominatim geocoding API was used to convert the addresses to lat/long coordinates. Ultimately, we did not end up using the coordinate data for each property since it made the visualization too cluttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of our first major issues with this was that our original dataset did
      not contain addresses with zip codes, so the API pulled coordinates of
      other matching addresses from other zip codes. This inaccuracy ranged
      anywhere from cities next to Alexandria to Ontario, Canada. Because of
      this, much of the coordinate data was initially unusable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another issue we ran into with a simple plot of all the points is that
      choropleths generally work better showing larger, more genralizable
      regions. To accomodate for this, we decided to plot the data grouping by
      zip code. As there was no readily avaiable geojson file for this purpose,
      a geojson file was created by the group with geojson.io, using the
      following Alexandria zip code map and the official Alexandria boundaries
      json file provided by the Alexandria Open Data project as reference to map
      the points accurately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond the geojson boundaries, we also ran into another familiar issue
      with our plan - our original dataset included addresses without the zip
      codes. Once we recieved the zip codes, it seemed like all of our problems
      would be fixed. Because of our new method, exact coordinates for each
      address would also be unecessary, as we would just need to map each
      address's data to its respective zip code.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Our zip code issues were solved using the USPS API to lookup zip codes to
      addresses. Since the addresses only included the street address and not the city or state, the city of Alexandria, VA was hard coded into the request.
      The API allowed for up to 500 requests/second and it took around 1h to 
      
      From this point, it was only a matter of plotting our data to
      the geojson boundaries in our TimeSliderChoropleth.

    <p>Of course, our initial plots are very simple 2 axis graphs. We can see that throughout the last decade, the average assessment and taxes of properties has gone up regardless of zip code. That being said, zipcodes like 22311 and 22314 are growing far more dramatically.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>This project was overall a very positive experience for our group, but not without its hurdles. 
    The most challenging part of the project was making use of real world data and figuring out how 
    to use it, which required uses of APIs and geojson tools we weren't initially familiar with. 
    Every time it seemed like we were making progress on one part we had been stuck on, another two more issues 
    would pop up. However, by the end we were able to make an interactive, functioning representation with our data.

    Special thanks to Professor Trenton Ford, who we could not have done this project without, and William Stanziano, who unfortunately had to leave the project early due to health reasons.
